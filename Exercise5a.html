<p>Information technology (IT) refers to everything that businesses use computers for. Information technology is building communications networks for a company, safeguarding data and information, creating and administering databases, helping employees troubleshoot problems with their computers or mobile devices, or doing a range of other work to ensure the efficiency and security of business information systems. Demand for professionals in this field is high and growing, and people entering the field have a range of career paths to choose from. The phrase “information technology” goes back to a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business Review. Authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler defined several types of information technology:

<ul>
<li>Techniques for the fast processing of information</li>
<li>The use of statistical and mathematical models for decision-making</li>
<li>The “simulation of higher-order thinking through computer programs.”</li></ul>

<li>Computer Support Specialist <br>
- These positions require a bachelor’s degree and are a good fit if you enjoy answering questions about computer software and hardware, setting up equipment, and training computer users. People in this position need to have a strong grasp of many kinds of software, including database interface programs, development of environment tools and operating system software. The median annual pay for this job is $53,000, and positions in this field are growing faster than average, according to BLS. </li>
<li>Network and Computer Systems Administrator <br>
– This job often requires a bachelor’s degree in a computer-related field, though some employers may only ask for an associate degree or postsecondary certificate. Either way, these jobs are often available to professionals without prior work experience in the field, and BLS reports that they paid a median salary of $82,000 in 2018. Daily tasks in this job could include maintaining computer network hardware and software, backing up data and troubleshooting network problems. To do this work, you need to know how to use database management software, as well as network monitoring and web platform development tools.</li>
<li>Computer Network Architect <br>
- This is a step up the career ladder for a network administrator and usually requires a bachelor’s degree and previous experience in the IT field. People in this position design and build networks, such as intranets, local area networks (LANs) and wide area networks (WANs). Median pay for this kind of work was $109,000 in 2018, according to the BLS. Network architects often need to understand a variety of software systems, including administration tools, development environment software and operating system programs. There’s also often an element of human touch to this job since network architects may need to work with customers and sales and marketing staff to meet customer needs and make sure accounts are set up correctly.</li>
<li>Database Administrator <br> 
– This fast-growing field involves protection and security of data such as financial information and customer shipping records. The jobs are often in specialized firms that provide services to other companies, or in data-heavy industries like insurance. The median pay for this work was $90,000 in 2018, according to BLS. Most employers expect candidates for the jobs to have a bachelor’s degree in an information- or computer-related discipline. It’s also helpful to understand database management software, as well as operating system tools, development environment and web platform software, and tools for enterprise resource planning.</li>
<li>Computer Systems Analyst <br> 
– This job, also known as system architect, demands an understanding of both IT and business systems. As with many information technology careers, the typical background for the job is a bachelor’s degree in a computer or information science field, but some people come to this work after studying business or even liberal arts. Strong computer skills, often including programming tools, database management software and development environment software are a must. At the same time, people doing this work must be able to apply computer systems to address business management issues like workflow, inventory control and production processes.

<li>Data <br>
- Facts and statistics collected together for reference or analysis. The quantities, characters, or symbols on which operations are performed by a computer, being stored and transmitted in the form of electrical signals and recorded on magnetic, optical, or mechanical recording media. </li>
<li>Internet <br>
- A global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities, consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols. In computer architecture, a word is a unit of data of a defined bit length that can be addressed and moved between storage and the computer processor. A word can contain a computer instruction, a storage address, or application data that is to be manipulated (for example, added to the data in another word space).</li>
<li>Software <br>
- The programs and other operating information used by a computer. Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. Examples of applications include office suites, database programs, web browsers, word processors, software development tools, image editors and communication platforms.</li>
<li>Database <br>
- A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. Where databases are more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques.  For example, a company database may include tables for products, employees, and financial records. Each of these tables would have different fields that are relevant to the information stored in the table.</li>
