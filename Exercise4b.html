She left him with a broken heart
He walks alone, confused.
Lost without her by his side
He softly sings the blues.
</i>
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: tahoma;color: red; text-align: left;font-size: 13pt;"><u>
In the darkened stormy night
He sings solemn tune.
Tears roll from his reddened eyes
As he strums, and drums, and croons.
</u>
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: chiller;color: green; text-align: center;font-size: 15pt;"><b><i>
The joyful music he once had sang
Only causes him to weep.
He thinks of the love he once had,
And how he set her free.
</b></i>
</pre>

<pre style="font=family: Harrington;font-size: 14pt; color: orange;text-align: right;"><u><i>
His fear of loss caused him to lose
The only love he's even known,
And now has nowhere to go,
Her arms were once his home.
</u></i>
</pre>

<pre style="font-family: forte;font-size: 14pt;color: yellow;text-align: center;"><i><u>
So he strolls down an empty street 
In search of a reason to hold on.
She is now his only muse,
And her memory is his song.
</u></b></i>
